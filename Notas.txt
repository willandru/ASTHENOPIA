Eye fatigue consists of two types: the functional decline of the
optical regulatory system, including muscle fatigue of the ciliary
muscle and other muscles that affect the focusing function, and
central fatigue of visual information processing that concerns the
cognitive process.[Kuwahara]

In both models, the use of an external lens in smart autofocusing 
wearable eyeglasses improves overall optical power while reducing 
strain on the ciliary muscle. However, it is important to note that in 
these eyeglasses, the optical power of the crystalline lens remains
relatively constant. As a result, prolonged exertion of the ciliary
muscle could result in eye fatigue, impacting individuals with both 
normal vision and presbyopia.[YAMHURE]


This innovative biofeedback system
offers promising potential for alleviating eye fatigue, particularly ciliary
muscle fatigue, by empowering persons to regulate the optical power
of their eyeglasses. By exerting control over the internal lens’s optical
power and subsequently inducing relaxation in the ciliary muscles, individuals
can effectively mitigate the strain experienced.[YAMHURE]

Consequently, the prolonged utilization of
such eyeglasses may result in fatigue of the ciliary muscles, as their
activity remains nearly constant over an extended duration. This phenomenon
closely resembles computer vision syndrome, characterized
by ocular strain and discomfort [16]. [YAMHURE]


To alleviate this fatigue, it is recommended to engage in relaxing
exercises such as yoga [20] or employ an external lens with variable
optical power controlled by the person or an automated system. This
enables the adjustment of the optical power to achieve focus and relax
the associated eye muscles.[YAMHURE]




The proposed experimental setup, allows for the independent adjustment
of each lens within the cascade of lenses, including the camera and the
cornea-lens system. This setup, depicted in Fig. 6, comprises the EMG
Controlled Image System (CIS), the Image Projection System (IPS), the
EMG system, and the Study Participant (SP). The results demonstrate
that, following a brief training period, all volunteers were able to
manipulate the camera’s focus to enhance image sharpness in the image
projection system. The contributions of this paper are as follows:[YAMHURE]
