In both models, the use of an external lens in smart autofocusing 
wearable eyeglasses improves overall optical power while reducing 
strain on the ciliary muscle. However, it is important to note that in 
these eyeglasses, the optical power of the crystalline lens remains
relatively constant. As a result, prolonged exertion of the ciliary
muscle could result in eye fatigue, impacting individuals with both 
normal vision and presbyopia.[YAMHURE]


This innovative biofeedback system
offers promising potential for alleviating eye fatigue, particularly ciliary
muscle fatigue, by empowering persons to regulate the optical power
of their eyeglasses. By exerting control over the internal lensâ€™s optical
power and subsequently inducing relaxation in the ciliary muscles, individuals
can effectively mitigate the strain experienced.[YAMHURE]
